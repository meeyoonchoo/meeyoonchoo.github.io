            A Deep Learning Graphical User Interface Application on MATLAB

          Deep learning, a new era of machine learning technique, shows the
          ability to generalize computational model through hierarchical layers
          by learning the features from a large amount of training data without
          any human intervention. Deep learning was mainly implemented in areas
          of computer vision, audio, and speech processing. Especially deep
          learning has greatly improved state of art in image classification.
          Image-based classification, the most classic but significant research
          topic, has been critically improved using deep learning architecture
          and outperformed the majority of state-of-the-art achievements. No
          bells and whistles, deep learning becomes the most popular research
          area. However, in order to train a comprehensive classifier, a large
          amount of data is inescapable, which apparently needs lots of
          computational time so that it requires fast GPUs to accomplish fast
          training. In general, powerful GPUs are expensive and the process of
          solving compatibility problems in both hardware and software are
          reluctant as a consequence, universities only have very limited access
          to GPUsâ€™ implementations. The main purpose of this paper is in
          identifying how to propagate principles of deep learning to students
          and build the bridge to make them learn and use deep learning easier
          or more accessible. In this paper, we develop a Graphic User Interface
          (GUI) deep learning for beginners to test classification results
          through CPU without massive training on computation. We use the
          high-performance GPU to train a model, once finished, we save the
          parameters of training model and load it to the GUI and provide a
          platform for students to do the testing.

            A Thought on Refactoring Java Loops Using Java 8 Streams
          </h2>
        </span>
        <h3>2017 Computer Sciences Commons</h3>
        <p>
          Java 8 has introduced a new abstraction called a stream to represent
          an immutable sequence of elements and to provide a variety of
          operations to be executed on the elements in series or in parallel. By
          processing a collection of data in a declarative way, it enables one
          to write more concise and clean code that can also leverage multi-core
          architectures without needing a single line of multithread code to be
          written. In this document, we describe our preliminary work on
          systematically refactoring loops with Java 8 streams to produce more
          concise and clean code. Our idea is to adapt existing work on
          analyzing loops and deriving their specifications written in a
          functional program verification style. Our extension is to define a
          set of transformation rules for loop patterns, one for each pattern,
          by decomposing the derived specification function into a series of
          stream operations.

            Writing JML Specifications Using Java 8 Streams
          </h2>
        </span>
        <h3>2016 Computer Sciences Commons</h3>
        <p>
          JML is a formal behavioral interface specification language for Java
          to document Java program modules such as classes and interfaces. When
          composing JML specifications, one frequently writes assertions
          involving a collection of values. In this paper we propose to use Java
          8 streams for writing more concise and cleaner assertions on a
          collection. The use of streams in JML can be minimal and non-invasive
          in the conventional style of writing assertions. It can also be
          holistic to write all assertions in the abstract state defined by
          streams. We perform a small case study to illustrate our approach and
          show its effectiveness as well. We then summarize our findings and the
          lessons that we learned from the case study.
